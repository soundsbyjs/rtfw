# rtfw
RTFW stands for "Read The Friendly Wiki"

This is a Web Scraper for those too lazy to open their browser and go to the Arch Wiki.

Pull all the content headers with rtfw -l [-List] [article name]

Pull all the content from one of those headers with -v [article name] [header]

So far it's really janky, cuz I have no idea what I'm doing.
I'd never written Python before Nov 30th lol
