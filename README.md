# rtfw
RTFW stands for "Read The Friendly Wiki"

This is a Web Scraper for those too lazy to open their browser and go to the Arch Wiki.

Pull a list of the sections in the article with ./rtfw [article name]

Pull all the content from one of those sections with ./rtfw [article name] [header]

# installation

I personally just made a simple bash script that cd's to where I installed the scraper and runs 

# python3 scraper.py $1 $2 $3

I figured some Linux head somewhere wouldn't like that so I left it up to the user to figure out
